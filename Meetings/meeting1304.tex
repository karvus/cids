\section{Meeting}

Many interesting things in the project guidelines. Have a look at in again.

Why did we choose clock synchronization. Last year the team did the same project. Clock sync is fine. We are working with logical clock, we will compare different algorithms and implementation of logical clocks. We can compare consensus  against non-consensus-based clock-synchronization algorithms. 

Larisa has two papers, it will up to us to read it through. We need not read all papers, we will be skimming a lot. 

Next week we need a specific problem, and we need to exactly sure what problem we face and be specific.

We are thinking about making a network simulation. We need to state in our why an external synchronization is not always the best choice. We need to be focused on our own skills, what is expected of us depends on this.

The midway seminar is in two week, abstract, research questions, we also probably need a plan for the project, next week we need to present this at the next meeting.

Larisa suggests a meeting on Wednesday, she is free most of the day, we can figure this out on Tuesday.

Motivations, why it's relevant, in the one slide:
