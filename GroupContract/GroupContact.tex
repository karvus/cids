\section{Group meetings}

The frequency of the meetings is to be 2 to 3 times a week. We will create a Facebook group, where we will arrange meetings and other details. If a person fails to cancel an appointment with the group, there will be slight punishment (maybe with cake). However the group expects communication from each individual if one cannot make it to a meeting.

At the last group meeting of each week, we will make a joint entry into the journal, summarizing the accomplishments make that given week.


\section{Social aspects of the group}



%Participation and division of the tasks of the group


\section{Meetings with supervisor}

We should all be present, and actively participating. One person is appointed to summarize the meeting, and the summary is made available to everyone involved after the meeting. Before each meeting we should discuss and plan the content and focus points of said meeting to avoid wasting time. 

\section{Ambition level}

As for ambition level we will strive towards a grade in the higher end of the spectrum, however we will also be satisfied with 10, or at worst 7.

\section{Contributions from each (strengths/weaknesses)}

Work is distributed as the project progresses. Deadlines are set for each part.

\section{Journal/Diary}
    %
    %There has to be at least one entry into the
    %journal each week.

    %Blackboard.
