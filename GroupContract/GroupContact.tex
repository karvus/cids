\maketitle

The frequency of the meetings is to be 2 to 3 times a week. We will create a facebook group, where we will arrange meetings and other details. If a person fails to cancel an appointment with the group, there will be slight punishment (maybe with cake). However the group expects communication from each individual if, one cannot make it to a meeting.

%Social aspects of the group

%Participation and division of the tasks of the group


%Meetings with supervisor


%Ambition level

As for ambition level we will strive towards a grade in the higher end of the spectrum, however we will also be satisfied with 10, or at worst 7.

%Journal/Diary

    %There has to be at least one entry into the
    %journal each week.
