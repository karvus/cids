We focused on discussing the upcoming mid-way seminar. Using the previously created outline for the presentation, we finalized our presentation for this seminar.

## 2018-05-01 Mid-way seminar

The mid-way seminar went well, however there was some mixed feedback regarding the inclusion of abstract mathematics. Overall, however it was good experience.

## 2018-05-04 Second group meeting of the week

In this meeting we went over what we have yet to do, especially regarding the report. We divided some basic tasks among ourselves. We have now started writing the report, and completing the last of the summaries of the key literature (SATS and MMTS). We have each taken responsibity for a part of the project. Regarding the theory section it should be done by the end of next week.

### Good experience

The week we have gotten started on our report.

### Problem

This week we've had an issue being specific, on which sections we individually wanted to work on, however this was resolved. We also only had two group meeting, however this was in the guidelines in the group contract.
