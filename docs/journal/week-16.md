# Week 16

## 2018-04-17 First group meeting of the week

We decided on a more concrete problem statement draft, which is to be ran past our supervisor at this week's meeting. We also focused on formalizing the project timeline, discussing which milestones are expected of us when.

We discussed the practical semantics of our decision to write an implementation of one or more algorithms, deciding to make a decision when we have a better overview of how the project plays out time-wise.

## 2018-04-18 Third meeting with supervisor

Larisa has added to the contract concerning absence. We discussed some issues regarding our coordination with Larisa, including how we plan the time of new meetings.

For the problem statement, we have mostly formalized it but still lack some details. We have made an initial time line based in the study guide. It is still considered rather vague, and we should go into more details before the halfway seminar.

We further discussed the halfway seminar a bit, namely what we should have ready for it.

## 2018-04-20 Second group meeting of the week

During the week a lot of work was put into literature searching. As a result of this we have found two algorithms we would like to work in depth with: ATS and MMTS. Finding these algorithms was the major roadblock for further work. Several papers on other algorithms have also been found, and might be useful when writing the perspectivation for our article.

Since we have now found the algorithms we are looking for, we have also been able to (mostly) finish our problem statement. Although we still lack details on which specific parameters we will compare for the algorithms, that is the only detail we lacked.

We have finalized our decision to implement a virtual distributed system to compare the algorithms, and have made an overall strategy for how the work will be distributed amongst the team members; however, we all agree that concrete plans of who will do what are better left for when we reach further into the project.

We will talk further over the weekend, and prepare for meeting Larisa early next week.

**Good experience**

We decided on the algorithms we will work with, which was a major roadblock. As such, we are now ready to properly begin the project.

**Problem**

Some issues with coordination between the group and our supervisor was felt, leading to poor experience. This will be worked on in the future.
