# Week 19

## 2018-05-08 Meeting with supervisor

At this meeting with Larisa we discussed our progress so far. We also discussed our tasks going forward in the process of the writing the report.

### 2018-05-08 Group meeting following meeting with supervisor

At this short group meeting we further discussed our process going forward. We all assumed responsibility of a problem to solve before the next group meeting. Because the bulk of the remaining work is to be done individually, we have agreed that group meetings would be slightly less frequent from now on. The purpose of these upcoming group meeting are tying up loose ends in the report, and updating each other on the process on the progress of our writing. 

## Problem

Because of the layout of the week (there was a holiday on Thursday and Friday) we haven't had more than one group meeting.

## Good experience

Regarding a good experience, we've had a good experience with continuing to make progress on the report and implementation of different time sync algorithms.
