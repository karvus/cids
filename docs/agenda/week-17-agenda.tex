\begin{itemize}
    \item Revised problem statement
          Still lacks specifics on comparison parameters, but how is it otherwise?
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Implementation
              We will implement two consensus-based algorithms (ATP \& MMTP).
    \end{itemize}
    \item Mid-way seminar
          Planning, how is our initial presentation skeleton, what is expected of us, ...
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Found in folder midwaypresentation/
    \end{itemize}
    \item Literature
          We have found articles for the algorithms we intend to go in-depth with, as well as multiple older algorithms for perspective. Still need to read and understand specifics (to e.g. find comparison parameters).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Overview found in literature/
    \end{itemize}
