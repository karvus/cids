What should we present for the exam? Project description, what was done either by you or the group as a whole. \underline{We should send Larisa a link to the git}.We have done the journal. The teoretical analysis can be brought to the exam. We have been searching the papers for advantages and disadvantages on ATS and MMTS. We are both working on the report and the implementation. We should have the report mostly done by Thursday next week, for our meeting at 13:00.
