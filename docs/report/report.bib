title = {The Byzantine Generals Problem},
booktitle = {},
year = {1982},
month = {7},
abstract = {I have long felt that, because it was posed as a cute problem about philosophers seated around a table, Dijkstra's dining philosopher's problem received much more attention than it deserves. (For example, it has probably received more attention in the theory community than the readers/writers problem, which illustrates the same principles and has much more practical importance.) I believed that the problem introduced in [41] was very important and deserved the attention of computer scientists. The popularity of the dining philosophers problem taught me that the best way to attract attention to a problem is to present it in terms of a story.

There is a problem in distributed computing that is sometimes called the Chinese Generals Problem, in which two generals have to come to a common agreement on whether to attack or retreat, but can communicate only by sending messengers who might never arrive. I stole the idea of the generals and posed the problem in terms of a group of generals, some of whom may be traitors, who have to reach a common decision. I wanted to assign the generals a nationality that would not offend any readers. At the time, Albania was a completely closed society, and I felt it unlikely that there would be any Albanians around to object, so the original title of this paper was The Albanian Generals Problem. Jack Goldberg was smart enough to realize that there were Albanians in the world outside Albania, and Albania might not always be a black hole, so he suggested that I find another name. The obviously more appropriate Byzantine generals then occurred to me.

The main reason for writing this paper was to assign the new name to the problem. But a new paper needed new results as well. I came up with a simpler way to describe the general 3n+1-processor algorithm. (Shostak's 4-processor algorithm was subtle but easy to understand; Pease's generalization was a remarkable tour de force.) We also added a generalization to networks that were not completely connected. (I don't remember whose work that was.) I also added some discussion of practical implementation details.},

It is focused on synchronization schemes based on exchange of signals at the physical layer and corresponding baseband processing, wherein analysis and design can be performed using known tools from signal processing.

Finally, we have touched upon synchronization of nonperiodic (chaotic) signals. Overall, we hope to have conveyed the relevance of the subject and to have provided insight on the open issues and available analytical tools that could inspire further research within the signal processing community.},

  abstract={This paper considers time synchronization in wireless sensor networks. When the communication delay is negligible, the maximum time synchronization (MTS) protocol is proposed by which the skew and offset of each node can be synchronized simultaneously. For a more practical case where the intercommunication delays between each connected node are positive random variables, we propose the weighted maximum time synchronization (WMTS), which is able to counteract the impact of random communication delays. Despite the clock offset that cannot be synchronized, WMTS can synchronize the clock skew completely in expectation and achieve acceptable synchronization accuracy. For both protocols, we provide rigorous proofs of global convergence as well as the upper bounds of their convergence time. Compared with existing consensus-based synchronization protocols, the main advantages of our protocols include: 1) a faster convergence speed so that the synchronization can be achieved in a finite time for MTS, and in a finite time in expectation for WMTS, respectively; 2) simultaneous synchronization of both skews and offsets; and 3) random communication delays can be handled effectively. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocols.},
