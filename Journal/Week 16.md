# Week 16

## 2018-04-17 First group meeting of the week

We decided on a more concrete problem statement draft, which is to be ran past our supervisor at this week's meeting. We also focused on formalizing the project timeline, discussing which milestones are expected of us when.

We discussed the practical semantics of our decision to write an implementation of one or more algorithms, deciding to make a decision when we have a better overview of how the project plays out time-wise.
