# Week 14

## 2018-04-05 First group meeting, group contract

For the first meeting, we discussed some points from the lecture
"Introduktion til projektarbejde FF501" by Marco Chiarandini, and the
group contract in particular.  To start off, the group contract,
meeting log and other items were created in ShareLaTeX, backed by a
github repository. 

We discussed a number of topics within the field of study, including

- Load balancing
- Time synchronization
- Banking transactions
- Peer-to-peer games
- Block-chain

These are all broad topics, and we decided to see if our supervisor
had specific topics to suggest.

Frequency of group meetings were tentatively decided to be 2-3 times
per week.

## 2018-04-06 First meeting with supervisor

The supervisor introduced some over-arching techniques for dealing
with the complexity of the project, and distributing work-load.

A frequency of meetings with supervisor, once a week, was agreed upon.

We presented the list of topics, all of which she approved of, and
noted that the deliverables doesn't necessarily be programming-heavy,
especially since there are readily available implementations of
e.g. Raft and Paxos in many programming languages.

We were provided a list of papers about the Byzantine Generals
problem, a Raft vs Paxos study, an analysis of Raft as well as the
book suggested for the project.
