\section{Initial problem statement}

Time synchronization is a widely known problem, that has many applications. E.g. multiple clients in a distributed system must agree on a single time in order to successfully tackle a problem. 
%Different consensus algorithms like Raft and Paxos, or different implementations of said algorithms can be used to solve such a problem.

We will compare various algorithms for clock synchronization in  distributed systems, and choose one (or multiple) algorithms to implement.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the advantages and disadvantages of the different kinds of time synchronization strategies (non-consensus vs. consensus)
    \item Describe and analyze [various] consensus-based time synchronization algorithms.
    \item Compare the algorithms, their advantages and disadvantages, and their areas of application.
\end{itemize}
