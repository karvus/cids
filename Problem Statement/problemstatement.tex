\section{Initial problem statement}

Time synchronization is a widely known problem, that has many applications. Eg. multiple clients in a distributed system must agree on a single time in order to successfully tackle a problem. Different consensus algorithms like Raft and Paxos, or different implementations of said algorithms can be used to solve such a problem.

We will compare various algorithms for clock synchronization in distributed systems, and choose one (or multiple) algorithms to implement.
